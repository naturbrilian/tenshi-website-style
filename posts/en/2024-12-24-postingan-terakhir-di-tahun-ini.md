It doesn't feel like 2024 is coming to an end, time is running faster and faster. The feeling of yesterday was just traveling with friends somewhere hehehe. Oh, I just checked the contents of the email too & there was a notification, that the domain price in 2025 will increase, which was originally only 12k, then increased to 25k for this year, and next year it will increase even further.

## What will be the fate of the main website & and this blog?
Oh, about this calm down, maybe just not renewing the domain, considering this domain will run out in August & I also plan to migrate to wixsite because the features are more complete & there is no need to put portfolios, blogs, and others in separate places.

## I made a tutorial wiki on hashnode in the past, will it also be merged into one?
Oh, this seems unnecessary because that was the original purpose of putting the tutorial on hashnode For this year, this is probably the last post on this blog & decided to leave it. This blog still exists, but only as an archive. Merry Christmas 2024 & New Year 2025, and see you in the new blog later, for now I copy all the contents of this blog (not including in hatena).
