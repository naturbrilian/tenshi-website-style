It feels like 2025 is coming to an end. I last wrote on this website in September, and after that I didn't write anything else. On the one hand, I also learned how to make my own website, which was quite fun.

## Enjoying the atmosphere of Surabaya for 1 week
Last November, when I had no activities, even though I was still working remotely, my family and I spent my vacation in Surabaya. Actually, we had many plans to visit historical sites such as Tugu Pahlawan, but due to time constraints and my mother and I suddenly falling ill, we were forced to rest.

Our first destination at that time was the Al Akbar Grand Mosque, whose location can be found on [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6WdMzMzfzSQiymr36?ref=archive.naturbrilian.dpdns.org). There were many interesting spots I wanted to visit, but unfortunately we had to pay to enter, so I decided not to go in.

The last time I went there was when I was still in first grade. I don't know if I forgot or what, but some things had changed. Yesterday, I only walked around the park because that was the only part that was free.

Then the next day, my mother and I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood, combining exercise with a search for food. It was very different from where I live, where everything you need to buy food is very close by. We just walked and found people selling food, unlike in Kediri, where you have to ride a motorcycle just to buy food.

## Finishing the funsite website project
After I returned home and went back to my lodgings, I was confused about what to do, so I decided to work on my fun website project. I felt that using AI to create it would be less exciting, so I learned from the website [https://htmlforpeople.com/](https://htmlforpeople.com/) with a few adjustments.

That's all for this article.
