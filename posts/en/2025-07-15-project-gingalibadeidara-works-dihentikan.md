Finally, after years of running this project, which from the beginning was focused on blogging, I decided to shut it down. However, on the other hand, if I wanted to change the name on [DeviantArt](https://deviantart.com/naturbrilian), I had to pay first. Oh yes, actually, the new DeviantArt already exists. I just happened to create it too.

So yesterday I posted this announcement on Facebook and my Discord server, because of suspected impersonation. In 2022, I actually wanted to stop this as soon as I found out that the name “Gingalibadeidara” was being used by irresponsible people, and at that time I had already reported it, but my report was completely ignored.

Here is the post:

Before making this status, I had already deleted my Twitter and [Misskey](https://misskey.id/) accounts.

## About the use of project names
After this project is discontinued, you are allowed to use this name, but please note that you should not include the name Liba in your project name, as this is my real name (the site owner). If you have any ideas for a replacement name, feel free to discuss them on my Discord server.
