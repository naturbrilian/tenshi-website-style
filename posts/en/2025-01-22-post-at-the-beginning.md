Good afternoon, this is finally my first post on the main site. Yesterday, I wanted to move to another website, but I changed my mind. Just now, I found a blog template that can be integrated with the main site, resume, and so on.

## What happened to the old template?
Honestly, at first I was interested in the Median UI template for a simple reason: it was the template used on Yurasub's website. However, since I currently need work for job applications and so on, I decided to overhaul the entire UI from Median to VCard.

Oh yes, in 2025, there will also be many interesting anime shows such as Hanashura, Kusuriya no Hitorigoto, and one more that's not on my watch list, Bang Dream! Ave Mujica.

Oh, yes, I myself had plans to move my domain from my id to web id, but I don't know why it can't be used, and the cause is still unknown. Yesterday, I contacted them via “send ticket” because they said I had to buy the domain myself. So, maybe I can't use it.
